    <h1>Hello <%= @guest.username %></h1>
    <p>
    Sadly the host can't accommodate you on that date. Your booking status for <strong><%= @booking.experience.title%></strong> has been changed to  <strong><%= @booking.status %></strong>
    </p>


    <p> You can try booking again at a later date or find another host. Just go back to <%= link_to 'Meet the Danes',show_experience_url(@booking.experience) %> </p>

    
    <p>Have a great day!</p>
